                <p>**This website is created for personal purposes.** </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Due to OpenAI's Builder Profile ChatGPT verification requires identity verification. You can use your own public web domain to verify this step. Therefore, I have used the web space for educational purposes. and test the use of some features of ChatGPT that are often used to help with learning</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fact that the information was put here was originally caused by the discovery of a problem with ChatGPT dealing with document files, whether knowledge or uploaded in chat. It has become GPTs that have a duty to focus on one aspect, more than normal, severe level. that uses document content on unrelated topics Including being focused on that piece of information beyond normal. Avoid using external data to supplement relevant or missing content and create incorrect content. This issue occurred in mid-December 2023, with documents being better able to be processed before then. Better use of data</p>
            <br>
            <p>And because Thai education has academic information that is difficult to search directly. Combined with specific vocabulary that lacks continuity with international content, as well as an educational style that is different from international thinking, makes ChatGPT unable to work effectively. Inserting teaching textbooks helps solve part of the problem. But the language's characters use a lot of window context. I'm not skilled enough to translate documents into English without leaving the context intact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As such, I have temporarily designated GPTs to use this information instead until we know if OpenAI can fix this issue. or have a clear policy announced In fact, there are more private methods, such as using APIs or creating data security in various ways. But I haven't had time to study much more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Therefore, most of the information on this website is primarily used for my study and is not intended to be disseminated for any other benefit. Including always informing content owners. (Some did not respond) This may include some text taken from various social media and summarized as information for use with GPTs. If any information is important and those involved want it to be able to Please inform me at my email.</p>
            <p>fun for build!!! place for ChatGPT because made for get builder profile.</p>
