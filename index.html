            <p>Information and the purpose of the site.</p>
                <p>**This website is created for personal purposes.** </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Due to OpenAI's Builder Profile ChatGPT verification requires identity verification. You can use your own public web domain to verify this step. Therefore, I have used the web space for educational purposes. and test the use of some features of ChatGPT that are often used to help with learning</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fact that the information was put here was originally caused by the discovery of a problem with ChatGPT dealing with document files, whether knowledge or uploaded in chat. It has become GPTs that have a duty to focus on one aspect, more than normal, severe level. that uses document content on unrelated topics Including being focused on that piece of information beyond normal. Avoid using external data to supplement relevant or missing content and create incorrect content. This issue occurred in mid-December 2023, with documents being better able to be processed before then. Better use of data</p>
            <br>
            <p>And because Thai education has academic information that is difficult to search directly. Combined with specific vocabulary that lacks continuity with international content, as well as an educational style that is different from international thinking, makes ChatGPT unable to work effectively. Inserting teaching textbooks helps solve part of the problem. But the language's characters use a lot of window context. I'm not skilled enough to translate documents into English without leaving the context intact.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As such, I have temporarily designated GPTs to use this information instead until we know if OpenAI can fix this issue. or have a clear policy announced In fact, there are more private methods, such as using APIs or creating data security in various ways. But I haven't had time to study much more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Therefore, most of the information on this website is primarily used for my study and is not intended to be disseminated for any other benefit. Including always informing content owners. (Some did not respond) This may include some text taken from various social media and summarized as information for use with GPTs. If any information is important and those involved want it to be able to Please inform me at my email.</p>
            <p>fun for build!!! place for ChatGPT because made for get builder profile.</p>
            <Br>
            <p>I recently had time to test some GPTs in the store, choosing the dalle group because it wasn’t very complicated to test. Selected from high, middle, and low ranks. of another acquaintance</p>
            <p>The first time, I threw in a single prompt for all of them, and the result was that all of the images had similar properties. It is considered to be lacking in the basics of creating a logo and for creating a tattoo style. I know more about the feeling than I have yet to pass in terms of a tatto.</p>
            <p>The prompt created is a background prompt used to send to DaLLE. Even though it’s different in GPT’s settings, the one created is a broad functionality that relates to documents (trand 2024, not related to tattoos or creation methods). specific instead shows images that are more tattoo-like.</p>
            <P>There is also a role-based test of GPT that concludes from their behavior that if it were me, I wouldn’t think of doing it. Because it is a waste of user messages. Contrast that with me creating a GPT that can generate the first image in 2 messages and using few tokens. If you not old player of market. Perhaps gaining popularity takes more than just effective work</P>
