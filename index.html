            <p>Information and the purpose of the site.</p>
                <p>**This website is created for personal purposes.** </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Due to OpenAI's Builder Profile ChatGPT verification requires identity verification. You can use your own public web domain to verify this step. Therefore, I have used the web space for educational purposes. and test the use of some features of ChatGPT that are often used to help with learning</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fact that the information was put here was originally caused by the discovery of a problem with ChatGPT dealing with document files, whether knowledge or uploaded in chat. It has become GPTs that have a duty to focus on one aspect, more than normal, severe level. that uses document content on unrelated topics Including being focused on that piece of information beyond normal. Avoid using external data to supplement relevant or missing content and create incorrect content. This issue occurred in mid-December 2023, with documents being better able to be processed before then. Better use of data</p>
            <p>Now it more stable. Control GPTS behavior in data usage more firmly.  And what is clearly understood is that Knowledge is not RAG. Knowledge cannot be used as a replacement. At least Knowledge does not need to embed vectors itself.  And splitting content doesn't help if GPT behaves in a way that doesn't support that file format.<p/> 
            <br>
            <p>
            <p>There will be new improvements to the basics of using DALLE to correct misunderstandings.  until the development is stuck  Now it is clear why DALLE has to learn directions or positioning in 3D. SORA is the answer, but currently there is still confusion about left and right often. This means that SORA that must be learned from DALLE ^30 should definitely revolve around itself.  Now DALLE is no different than being a parameter for SORA. DALL's growth has a direct impact on SORA.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I will leave the knowledge on how to use Dalle that I have learned and understood from my field of knowledge on this website.  You can study it.  But it's not ML knowledge.</p>
            <p>fun for build!!! place for ChatGPT because made for get builder profile.</p>
