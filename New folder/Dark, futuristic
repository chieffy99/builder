**Visual Theme:**  
- Dark, futuristic glassmorphism aesthetic with a deep charcoal background.  
- Animated vertical lines and glowing dots create a sense of depth and subtle motion.  
- Cards and menus use semi-transparent backgrounds, rounded corners, and soft shadows for a floating effect.  
- Gradient accents in blue and purple highlight interactive elements.

**Top Navigation Bar:**  
- A slim, semi-transparent bar fixed at the top, featuring a compact logo, clear title, and primary navigation links.  
- The navbar uses backdrop blur and gradient highlights for a modern look.

**Central Workspace Canvas:**  
- The main content area is a full-bleed, uncluttered canvas where users interact with draggable and resizable cards.  
- Each card presents a focused data view—charts, tables, or summaries—styled with rounded corners and subtle shadows.  
- Cards can be freely positioned and resized within the workspace.

**Floating Action Button (FAB):**  
- A circular, gradient-accented button anchored to the bottom-right corner.  
- Tapping the FAB reveals a compact menu of card creation shortcuts, presented as icon buttons in a vertical and horizontal stack.  
- All dashboard actions—adding charts, tables, summaries, or custom cards—are accessed via the FAB menu, keeping the interface clean and focused.  
- The FAB menu uses animated reveals and tooltips for clarity and accessibility.
- FAB again to Dismissal collapses the menu back into the single FAB, using a reverse animation to reset the interface.



**Card Design:**  
- Cards are draggable and resizable, with glassmorphism backgrounds and soft drop shadows.  
- Card headers include a title and minimal action buttons (e.g., close, stack/combine).  
- Cards support stacking/combining for advanced analytics, with all actions accessible from the card or FAB menu.

**Typography:**  
- Thai and English font support using 'Prompt' and 'Sarabun'.  
- Headings use gradient text for emphasis.

**Animations:**  
- Smooth transitions for card movement, resizing, and FAB menu interactions.  
- Animated background elements enhance the futuristic feel.

**Mobile Responsive:**  
- The FAB and menu remain accessible and touch-friendly on all devices.  
- The workspace and cards adapt fluidly to different screen sizes.  
- No persistent sidebars or overlays block content.

**Component Patterns:**  
- All dashboard actions (add, combine, stack, etc.) are accessible from the FAB menu.  
- The interface remains clean, focused, and free from modal or sidebar clutter.
